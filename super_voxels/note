Elastic deformation may be done via enlarging or making smaller some supervoxels and use mesh grid to make it work



Plan:
1) get sobel filtered version of the original image
2) define data loading including augmentations on slices in order to make the contrastive learning possible
3) for contrastive learning we need also to keep the information which are positive and which are negative pairs
4) Function g is a 1Ã—1 convolutional layer followed by a K-way softmax projecting
the feature maps to a distribution over K cluster
5) we want to increase similarity between positive pairs and decrese between negative similarity criterion is basically mutual information
6) optimise and visualize
