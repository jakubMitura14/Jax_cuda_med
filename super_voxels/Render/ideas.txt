Pixel wise loss in main function in the end just sum

We can in each iteration make sure that the verticies that are shared by 2 are in given run updated only by single parameter update
it may be tricky - additionally we need to make sure that those coordinates will be set to the lastly updated coordinates in all verticies
maybe other but possibly less efficient way is to update positions each time as a center for all coordinates proposed by all updates
this could be potentially done by sth like half edge mesh - so storing data what is adjacent in each direction ...

additionally loss could be increased when a) variance is very small - so for example outside the body
                                          b) points of a single supervoxels are not spreadout - they should maximize the relative distance between themselves

so when we use SNIC as preprocessing we can then potentially with polygonization
get nice representation 

so in order to simplify the interpolation part - and batch a bit supervoxels
we can first calculate the distance of calculated center to closest point on a GRID
look at differentiable round above
