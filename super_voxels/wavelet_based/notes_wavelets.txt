wavelets done as just tensor product are highy dependent on shift
they also easily loose dirrectionality

shoft invariance can be generally acquired through stationary wavelet transform
and directionality can be better captured by complex wavelet transform

dual tree complex wavelet transform
the implementation seem to be in numpy and python 
https://github.com/rjw57/dtcwt

check weather there is no recursion there

on the basis of this https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/pubs/CWT_Tutorial.pdf
it seems that until there are no edges the fourier is ok - Hovewer I suppose that
small vessels would count as edges ...
