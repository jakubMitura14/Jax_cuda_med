factor graph texture 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/PGMax/blob/master/examples/pmp_binary_deconvolution.ipynb#scrollTo=q8JeiQCj6GC-

texture could be analyzed by subtracting the binned arrays 
so lets say that we solved the throsholding problem we already have a way to get the image transformed so it would have all intensities in lets say 32 bins
ok so we are interested to find the frequency of local cooccurences of those intensities   
preferably would be nice to get those intensities directionally; but possibly for increased robustness rotation invariant variant would be better

so we have the matrix of integer like values representing the presence in the bins 
now we want the absolute differences in all axes of the array and 1 shifted version

we are interested only in absolute values hence -2 and 2 will be considered the same

now problem is that 2 can represent both pair 32 and 30 like as well 2 and 4
so we can multiply the values by 100 and add those differences
hence pair 30 and 32 will become 3002 and pair 2 and 4 will become 202
if we will keep having problems with rounding error after multiplying by 100 we may instead just keep 2 numbers as a single id

next we can do the histogram of such ids and effectively we would sum the frequency of the intensity pairs in the image 

we can add those histogram from different shifts in different axes to get rotation invariance
