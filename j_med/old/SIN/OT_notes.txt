We can do downsampling interpolation of the other representation of the sv histograms by getting the Wasserstein barycenters of the surrounding supervoxels 

so we basically can do the same procedure as primary supervoxels but with measuring the OT cost between SV histogram and minimize sum of those consts
and do the downsampling by wasserstein barycenters
