gumbel softmax can be taken from 
https://github.com/google/jaxopt


so we get each mask in separate floats so for 2D 4 channels 
we initialize them with ones in the centers of the supervoxels - then we also put those into the results probably
    this would be both input as well as would be added to result before softmax
    before softmax we can also consider average kernel (https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/mean.htm)
sth like relaxation labelling
    simplest idea - is to use a combination of differentiable and plus deifferentiable or ...
    and use it as additional loss function - so such voxels should not be present
    alternatively each sv area should be graph with strong penalization if label with 1 has no adjacent ones
then gumbel softmax
then differentiable diff_round
